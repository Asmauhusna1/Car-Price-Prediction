ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

This project predicts car prices based on multiple features such as mileage, year, fuel type, and engine size using machine learning models.  
It compares several regression algorithms to determine which performs best.

ðŸ“Š Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow)
